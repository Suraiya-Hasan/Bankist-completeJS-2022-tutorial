# Bankist-completeJS-2022-tutorial
An HTML, CSS and JS project from the complete JavaScript course 2022 by Jonas Schmedtmann implementing array methods, timers, numbers and date functionality of JavaScript.


This JS project has a "login" funtionality which does not necessarily "logs a user in" rather just displays the UI. The user has to be an object
in the accounts array. The user can login using username and corresponding pin.

The user can transfer money to other existing users but not to themselves. They have to use the username of the other accounts and an amount
smaller or equal to current balance.

The user can also request for a loan for an amount greater than 0 and has to have a deposit of at least 10% of asking amount.

The user can also close their account specifying their name and pin.

The value of the above mentioned functionalities are for one particular session. Reloading will set it to initial coded state.

1. Install nodeJS (not required if already installed)
2.  Download the zip
3. Go to the folder where the files are located
4. Open a terminal
